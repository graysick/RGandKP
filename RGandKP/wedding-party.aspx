They joined the same sorority, Zeta Tau Alpha, and still keep in close touch.  Mary has been Katie's closest friend and confidante, through thick and thin, for years.  Katie doesn't know where she'd be without her.

She has become such a huge part of Katie’s life that, without her, it just wouldn’t be complete.

Katie really does think of her like a big sister that paves the way, gives lots of advice, and pushes you to be the best version of yourself.  Kayla has been a true friend and someone that Katie has always admired and looked up to.

Katie feels that she and Courtney really helped each other and grew together during those years at school.  They have stayed in touch since freshman year and will surely stay connected for years to come.
