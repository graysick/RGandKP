                My main goal with the proposal was to surprise the heck out of Katie.  As far as she knew, I had no plan to "pop the question" any time in the near future.  The words "marriage" and "engagement" had been discussed very few times over the years and the discussions hadn't gone far, though I always knew she was the girl for me.  I finally felt that the time was right, and began researching rings.  It took a few weeks before I found what I was looking for, and I jumped to order it before the Christmas rush.  <br /><br />Since it was so close to Christmas, my budget for other gifts for Katie was almost completely depleted, so I gave her a few knick-knacks and filler gifts with the promise that a big present was waiting for her back in Durham.  She fell for it.  For the next 3 days she was bummed out.  Then came the mountains trip.  We drove up to Todd, NC with my family, unpacked a bit, and headed out for the waterfall.  Now, I knew I was going to do it on the trip, but I wasn't sure about the FIRST DAY.  I grabbed the ring anyways as we walked out the door, and hid it in my camera flash case.  We arrived at the waterfall, and things couldn't have been more perfect.  Surrounded by the frozen trees of the forest and the sound of the waterfall, I bent down to "get my flash out," and pulled out the ring.  She said "YES".

                For the weekend of the 28th through the 31st, Ryan and I went to the mountains in Todd, NC with his family.  Once we all got to the cabin that Friday afternoon, we decided to go for hike.  The forest was frozen and beautiful.  We finally came to a large waterfall.  The path wound beside the waterfall with a couple of lookout points along the way.  At each lookout point, Ryan would take what seemed like an endless number of waterfall pictures.  In the meantime, his family would have moved on down the path and I would be stuck waiting on Ryan.  After going through this once already, we got to a second lookout point and the same thing happened.  <br /><br />By then I was getting frustrated and fussing at him to hurry up.  He responded by saying "just let me get my flash real quick".  I couldn't believe that he was going to get out the flash for his camera, which he keeps in a case in his backpack, to take more pictures!  I was then distracted by the fact that he had not only set his backpack down in the mud but he was kneeling down in it, successfully getting both his bag and jeans muddy.  In the meantime, Ryan had started opening his flash case.  However, instead of a flash, there was a ring box inside.  Already kneeling, Ryan told me that my Christmas present had, in fact, arrived on time.  Grinning, undoubtedly pleased with his success in surprising me, Ryan asked if I would marry him.  Even now, so soon afterward, I can't remember anything that I said from that point on.  According to Ryan, my response was "yes, obviously!".
